This directory will house mentor-facing layouts, shared UI primitives, and route pages.

- Place reusable components for the mentor dashboard in `./components/`.
- Implement mentor-specific screens (requests inbox, profile editor, etc.) in `./pages/`.
- Reference the student feature module for examples of how to compose the shared layout.

Files can stay empty until the mentor experience is implemented; this README keeps the folder structure in source control.
